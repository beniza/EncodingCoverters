# Ur-Nag Transliteration

Many socio-linguists consider Urdu and Hindi as textbook examples of `diagraphia` - a linguistic situation in which varities of same language written in different script (Ahmed 2011)<sup>[1](#urdu-in-deva)</sup>.

Although both these languages share a lot of linguistic features, they differ in several important aspects, such as the `vocabulary`, `orthography` and `identity of the speakers` etc. For the Muslim dominant Urdu speakers, Arabic (Script of the Holi Quran) based Nastaliq is the script of choice and they borrow words from `Persio-Arabic` languages, wherein, the Hindu dominant Hindi speakers write in Devanagari (the script of Hindu scriptures) and loan words from `Sanskrit`. It is evident that the diagraphic situation is related to the religious identities and the social desire for linguistic differenciation (Ahmed, p1).

Urdu is the national language of Pakistan. In India, Hindi is actively promoted through the education system and media. Contraray to the widesprea belief of Hindi is India's national language, Gujarat High Court has observed that "there was nothing on record to suggest that any provision has been made or order issued declaring Hindi as a national language of the country."<sup>[2](#hindi-no-national-language)</sup>

Children in school are taught to read and write these languages using the script promoted by the respective Governments. While this is not a problem for the Muslim children in Pakistan and Hindu children in India, it becomes a challenges for Urdu speaking children in India and Hindi speaking children in Pakistan. In order to circumvalent this issue, systems emerged over the years to transliterate Urdu in Devanagari (commonly known as `Ur-Nag`) and Hindi in Urdu.

## Challenges in transliterating between Urdu and Devanagari
There are several major challenges involved in transliterating from one language to another. People often consider that transliteration is just a mapping of character to character. But in reality the issue is far more complicated than that. Below are a few major elements that complicates this process:

  * **Contextual substitutions**: This happens when a character takes a different shape according to the context it appear. 
    *(give an example of free and bound vowels in Hindi, and an example from Urdu)*

  * **Inconsistent spellings**: These are not accidental spelling mistakes, but the differences by deliberate spelling choices.
    * Socio-cultural or geographical factors. (precense of silent Urdu phonemes `baRi-he` or `ain`)
    * Phonemic mismatches (`mez` or `mej`/`quda` or `khuda`).
  * **Encoding issues**:
    * Keyboarding systems (`zw-standardization`)
